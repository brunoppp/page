I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis.

My research employs applied economic tools to examine the interplay between climate, property rights, and land use. My dissertation examines how ranchers on public and private lands in the Brazilian Amazon adapt their land-use practices in response to droughts. The study highlights the critical role of property rights in shaping the effectiveness of policies aimed at mitigating climate-related shocks. Expanding my research, I am examining the impact of the Amazon Soy Moratorium on ranchers' land-use decisions. 


Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and a B.A. in economics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais.

I am currently seeking research and teaching positions. Please feel free to contact me at bpimenta@ucdavis.edu.
