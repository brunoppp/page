Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis.

**I am on the job market this fall (AY 2025-2026).**

I am mostly interested in Environmental Economics, land use, and climate change.  My job market paper examines how ranchers on public and private lands in the Brazilian Amazon adapt their land-use practices in response to droughts. The study highlights the critical role of property rights in shaping the effectiveness of policies aimed at mitigating climate-related shocks. Expanding my research, I am examining the impact of the Amazon Soy Moratorium on ranchers' land-use decisions. 


Before joining UC Davis, I earned my M.A. in economics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and a B.A. in economics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
