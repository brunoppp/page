**The Differential Responses of Farmers on Private and Public Lands to Droughts in the Brazilian Amazon** with Matthew Reimer and Kevin Novan (draft soon)

### Abstract

Climate change has made drought events in the Amazon more frequent. Manmade deforestation can further deteriorate the region's climate, and weather conditions may also influence a farmer's decision to deforest. The Brazilian Amazon is a mosaic of public and private lands, and farmers in public lands may not have incentives to manage their lands sustainably. This study investigates how differently droughts affect farmers' land use decisions across public and private lands. Comparing pasture expansion in private and public lands within the same 0.5° cells, we find that farmers in public lands accelerate their pasture expansion compared to those in private lands during drought years. Investigating the possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we find that droughts affect pasture degradation, which in turn affects pasture expansion. Farmers in public lands are more sensitive to pasture degradation than private land farmers, which is evidence that public land farmers move to new land after their pasture is degraded. The findings also inform policymakers to increase the monitoring of public lands during drought years and design mechanisms to better enforce property rights in the region.
