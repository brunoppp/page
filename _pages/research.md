**The Differential Responses of Farmers on Private and Public Lands to Droughts in the Brazilian Amazon** with Matthew Reimer and Kevin Novan (draft soon)

### Abstract

Climate change has made drought events in the Amazon more frequent. Manmade deforestation can further deteriorate the region's climate, and weather conditions may also influence a farmer's decision to deforest. The Brazilian Amazon is a mosaic of public and private lands, and farmers in public lands may not have incentives to manage their lands sustainably. This study investigates how differently droughts affect farmers' land use decisions across public and private lands. Comparing pasture expansion in private and public lands within the same 0.5° cells, we find that farmers in public lands accelerate their pasture expansion compared to those in private lands during drought years. Investigating the possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we find that droughts affect pasture degradation, which in turn affects pasture expansion. Farmers in public lands are more sensitive to pasture degradation than private land farmers, which is evidence that public land farmers move to new land after their pasture is degraded. The findings also inform policymakers to increase the monitoring of public lands during drought years and design mechanisms to better enforce property rights in the region.

**The Effects of the Amazon Soy Moratorium on Cattle Ranchers’ Land Use Decisions** with Matthew Reimer and Kevin Novan

In the 2000s soybean cultivation rapidly expanded across the Brazilian  Amazon. Following a provocative Greenpeace report, companies controlling the soy trade signed an agreement to stop purchasing soybeans from deforested land, called the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM). Nonetheless, soybean cropland continued to expand by shifting from clearing forests to displacing pastureland. In the final iteration of the moratorium, it was agreed that the companies should buy no soybeans from lands deforested after 2008. By restricting the purchase of soybeans to lands deforested before 2008, the ASM may have also influenced the cattle ranchers' land-use decisions. If soybean farmers expand their cropland to pastureland deforested before 2008, but ranchers relocate their cattle to forested regions, the policy is undermined. However, the policy could also have its effect compounded if it dissuades ranchers from acquiring new land. Finally, extensive ranchers may shift from selling their land from soybean farmers to other producers, or they may invest in the land and adopt more intensive practices. This research examines the impact of the ASM on land-use decisions in the cattle ranching sector. More specifically, this research investigates how a policy aimed at reducing deforestation among soybean farmers affected cattle ranchers' decisions to deforest and invest in their land. 


**Green Deserts** with Ignacio Oliva

Land conservation and restoration are key strategies to mitigate climate change and its impacts. Investing in tree plantations monocultures (ITP) can be a profitable and effective way to increase forested areas. However, this strategy may affect the provision of ecosystem services such as freshwater availability and wildfire control. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the expansion of ITP in Chile on freshwater availability and wildfire control. Exploiting land-use changes promoted by a subsidy introduced in Chile in 1974, we employ different strategies to estimate ecosystem service provision changes due to ITP expansion. 
First, we use distance to the closest wood mill before the subsidy was implemented as an instrumental variable to address the endogeneity
between ITP expansion and changes in ecosystem service provision. Second, we estimate the long-term effects of ITP using long differences. Finally, we use a panel fixed-effects model to check the consistency of our results.
